            <h1>Hi! Welcome to Streak Coding</h1><br/>
            <hr>
            <h2>Round 1: Trace for Pass</h2>
            There are 3 rounds, in the first round you will be given a C++ or Java program (your choice)<br/>
            You'll have to find the output of the program manually using pen and paper.<br/>
            The faster you find the correct answer, the better head start you gain to the next round<br/>
            Added to that faster teams would get more points than the relatively slower teams and wrong submissions result in a reduction in score<br/>
            All of this score would be maintained by a state-of-the-art leaderboard designed by the Streak Coding team<br/>
            The correct answer would fetch you the link to the second round<br/><br/>
            <hr/>
            <h2>Round 2: The Streak</h2>
            The second round will consist of 11 coding questions of easy - medium difficulty hosted in the HackerRank platform<br/>
            We would test here not how much difficult problems you are able to solve. Instead, we would look at how fast you are able to solve simple problems<br/>
            The score for this round is your HackerRank score + the points you may have gathered in the first round<br/>
            The top 6 teams at the end of this round would be chosen for the next round held the next day<br/><br/>
            <hr/>
            <h2>Round 3: The Final Streak</h2>
            The finalists will be given 7 coding questions hosted in the HackerRank platform<br/>
            In this round, we will not only look at the speed of your problem solving ability, we will also see whether you are able to solve complex problems with efficient solutions<br/>
            The leaderboard for this round would consider 30% of the last round and 70% of this round<br/>
            The top two scorers will be given the title of "The Streak Coder of Ubertech19" along with a cash award<br/><br/>
